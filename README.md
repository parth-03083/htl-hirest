# üßê Project philosophy

> Hirest is an all-in-one hiring platform which includes job posting, job application, job application tracking system and recieving it's update on phone as text messages using Twilio. Also, we have implemented the unique feauture of broadcasting service for reducing the tediousness of sharing same documents to multiple users. This feature reads a list of recipients from a CSV file and then broadcasts it to them. 
> 
> There are other features like Skill Development Suggestion, Skill-Based Job Suggestions, Resume builder, and rigorous filtering system to help you find exactly what you are looking for.
> 
> Also, we have uploaded our code on Github and registered the domain name for our platform as "hirest.co" from GoDaddy Registry. For generating the resume, we have used the ApyHub API to convert the profile into a Resume of the user.
